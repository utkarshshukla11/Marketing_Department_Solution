# 🏢 Bank Customer Segmentation– Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Objective
Banks often deal with thousands of customers, each with unique behaviors and needs. Instead of treating all customers the same, segmentation helps identify groups (e.g., high spenders, savers, loan seekers) for better data-driven decision making.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters
This project focuses on segmenting bank customers using clustering techniques. By analyzing customer data over 6 months, we uncover meaningful groups that help the marketing team design personalized campaigns, improve customer engagement, and reduce costs.
